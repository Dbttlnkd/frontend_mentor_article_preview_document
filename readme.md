## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my 2nd project since I start learning HTML/CSS mid-June.
This project helped me in testing my learning around responsive design and use of JavaScript for small animations.

I spend a little time to find a way to remove the active button when clicking in the window.

Not sure if the integration of the logo directlty in CSS is the best way to do it but it works ! Don't hesitate to bring feedbacks !
